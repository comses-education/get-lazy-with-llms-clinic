    Here is a list of responses to the question: "What would you not entrust to an AI assistant?"

    1. **Asking general knowledge-base questions** â€” can't trust the accuracy.
    2. **Using unpublished text/data** â€” LLMs can produce rough drafts only, not polished outputs.
    3. **Writing** â€” anything beyond structure or idea generation should be verified or rewritten.
    4. **Tasks that require precision or accuracy** â€” always verify; don't rely on LLMs for exact figures or details.
    5. **Personal issues** â€” avoid using LLMs for personal advice or decision-making.
    6. **Literature review, hypothesis generation, scientific writing** â€” needs narrowing, sourcing, and expert validation.
    7. **Critical analysis of research** â€” LLMs need specific criteria and clear instructions for evaluation.
    8. **Complex coding logic** â€” break down tasks and request explanations; never use outputs blindly.
    9. **Logical reasoning and original ideas** â€” useful for brainstorming, but not for validated conclusions.
    10. **Following instructions consistently** â€” can struggle with multi-step or rule-based tasks unless broken down.
    11. **Pretty much everything** â€” always verify, never copy-paste without reviewing.
    12. **Literature review and creative processes like scientific writing** â€” use as a collaborator, not an authority.

    For each concern from the list generate:
    - 3 simple example queries 
    - suggest ways to improve each simple queries
    - suggest improved queries for each simple query

    Output format: markdown table with following rows: 
    - I wouldn't rely on LLM to do
    - Example Prompt
    - Suggestions for Improvement
    - Improved Prompt. 

    All 3 examples for each concern should be in 1 row.
```

2. **Structure your prompts** with organized formats like bullet points or numbered lists to help the LLM process information more effectively  
3. **Provide relevant context** to help the model understand the background and purpose of your request  
4. **Break down complex tasks** into manageable components to improve accuracy  
5. **Include example outputs** to guide the model toward your desired format and content  
6. **Request explanations** of the reasoning process behind answers using chain-of-thought prompting  
7. **Understand the limitations** of context windows and model capabilities
