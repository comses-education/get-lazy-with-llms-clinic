# Landlab Documentation, Tutorials, and Contribution Guide

This section provides a comprehensive guide to navigating and utilizing the Landlab documentation, tutorials, and examples. It also outlines the process for contributing to the Landlab project, based on the information contained within the project's documentation structure.

## 1. Overview of Landlab (Based on Documentation)

Landlab is an open-source Python package designed for numerical modeling of Earth surface dynamics. Key features highlighted in the documentation include:

*   **Gridding Engine:** Supports both regular (raster, hex) and irregular (Voronoi, network) grids to represent model domains.
*   **Component Library:** Offers a collection of pre-built process components (e.g., flow routing, erosion, diffusion) with standardized interfaces that can be combined to build custom models.
*   **Utilities:** Provides tools for numerical methods, file I/O, and visualization.
*   **Tutorials:** Includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating core concepts and usage examples.

The primary goal is to save researchers time by providing reusable, standardized building blocks for landscape modeling, fostering a collaborative development environment.

## 2. Getting Started with Landlab

This part guides new users through installation and initial exploration.

### 2.1. Installation

Landlab can be installed using common Python package managers. It is **highly recommended** to install Landlab within a dedicated virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

**Using Virtual Environments:**

*   **Mamba/Conda:**
    ```bash
    # Install mamba if needed: conda install mamba -c conda-forge
    mamba create -n landlab_env python=3.11 # Or desired Python version
    mamba activate landlab_env
    ```
*   **venv (built-in):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv # Create environment in .venv directory
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    ```

**(Source: `docs/source/install/environments.md`)**

**Installation Methods:**

Once the environment is activated:

*   **Recommended (using Mamba/Conda):** Provides pre-compiled binaries for faster installation and better dependency management, especially for complex dependencies.
    ```bash
    # Using mamba (faster)
    mamba install landlab -c nodefaults -c conda-forge --override-channels

    # Using conda
    conda install landlab -c nodefaults -c conda-forge --override-channels
    ```

*   **Using pip:** Installs from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
    ```bash
    pip install landlab
    ```

**(Source: `README.md`, `docs/source/installation.md`)**

**Updating and Uninstalling:**

*   **Update:**
    ```bash
    # Conda/Mamba
    conda update landlab # or mamba update landlab

    # Pip
    pip install --upgrade landlab
    ```
*   **Uninstall:**
    ```bash
    # Conda/Mamba
    conda remove landlab # or mamba remove landlab

    # Pip
    pip uninstall landlab
    ```

**(Source: `docs/source/install/update_uninstall.md`)**

### 2.2. Developer Installation

If you plan to modify Landlab's code or contribute new features, install from the source code:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/landlab/landlab.git
    cd landlab
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate Environment:** Use Mamba/Conda or venv as described above. Use the provided environment files for convenience:
    ```bash
    # For Conda/Mamba (includes dev tools)
    mamba env create -f environment-dev.yml # Creates 'landlab_dev' env
    mamba activate landlab_dev

    # Or install dependencies manually if needed
    # mamba install --file=requirements.in --file=requirements-testing.in --file=requirements/dev.txt -c conda-forge
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies (if not using environment file):**
    ```bash
    # using pip
    pip install -r requirements.in -r requirements-testing.in -r requirements/dev.txt

    # using mamba/conda (preferred for compiling extensions)
    mamba install --file=requirements.in --file=requirements-testing.in --file=requirements/dev.txt -c conda-forge
    ```
4.  **Build and Install Landlab (Editable Mode):** This requires a C++ compiler (install via `conda install compilers` or system tools like XCode/MSVC).
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    The `-e` flag installs the package in "editable" mode, meaning changes you make to the source code are immediately reflected when you import Landlab in Python.

**(Source: `README.md`, `docs/source/install/developer_install.md`, `environment-dev.yml`, `requirements*.txt`)**

### 2.3. First Steps and Core Concepts

The documentation introduces key Landlab concepts:

*   **Model Grid:** The representation of the spatial domain. Grids contain elements like nodes, links, cells, faces, etc., with defined connectivity and geometry. Different grid types (Raster, Hex, Voronoi, Network, etc.) are available. *(See `docs/source/user_guide/grid.md`, `docs/source/user_guide/grid_summary.md`)*
*   **Fields:** Data arrays associated with specific grid elements (e.g., `topographic__elevation` at nodes). They are the primary way data is stored and shared. *(See `docs/source/user_guide/fields.md`, `docs/source/user_guide/field_definitions.md`)*
*   **Components:** Reusable modules representing specific physical processes (e.g., `FlowAccumulator`, `LinearDiffuser`). They interact with the grid and its fields. *(See `docs/source/user_guide/components.md`, `docs/source/user_guide/component_list.md`)*

**Building a Model:** A typical Landlab model involves writing a Python script (the "driver") that:
1.  Imports necessary libraries and Landlab classes (Grid, Components).
2.  Instantiates the grid.
3.  Instantiates required components, linking them to the grid.
4.  Initializes grid fields (e.g., topography).
5.  Sets boundary conditions on the grid.
6.  Runs the model, typically in a time loop, calling component `run_one_step()` methods.
7.  Processes or visualizes results.

**(Source: `docs/source/user_guide/build_a_model.md`)**

**Conceptual Driver Structure:**

```python
import numpy as np
from landlab import RasterModelGrid
from landlab.components import FlowAccumulator, FastscapeEroder # Example components

# 1. Import (already done)

# 2. Instantiate Grid
grid = RasterModelGrid((50, 50), xy_spacing=10.0)

# 3. Initialize Fields
z = grid.add_zeros("topographic__elevation", at="node")
z += np.random.rand(grid.number_of_nodes) * 0.1 # Example initial noise

# 4. Set Boundary Conditions
grid.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(True, True, True, False) # Example: open bottom

# 5. Instantiate Components
fa = FlowAccumulator(grid)
sp = FastscapeEroder(grid, K_sp=1e-5) # Example parameters

# 6. Run Model
dt = 1000.0 # years
run_duration = 50000.0 # years
uplift_rate = 0.001 # m/yr

current_time = 0.0
while current_time < run_duration:
    # Apply uplift
    z[grid.core_nodes] += uplift_rate * dt

    # Run components
    fa.run_one_step()
    sp.run_one_step(dt)

    current_time += dt

# 7. Finalize (e.g., plot)
from landlab.plot import imshow_grid
imshow_grid(grid, "topographic__elevation")
```

## 4. Navigating the User Guide and Reference

The online documentation ([https://landlab.csdms.io](https://landlab.csdms.io)) is generated from the files in `docs/source/`.

*   **User Guide:** Provides topic-based explanations (e.g., Grids, Components, Fields, Units, FAQ, Building a Model).
*   **API Reference:** Details the public functions, classes, and methods. It is largely auto-generated from code docstrings.
*   **Listings:** The documentation uses an `index.toml` file (`docs/index.toml`) to generate comprehensive lists of:
    *   Components (`docs/source/user_guide/component_list.md`)
    *   Standard Field Names and Definitions (`docs/source/user_guide/field_definitions.md`)
    *   Grid Methods Summarized by Category (`docs/source/user_guide/grid_summary.md` and `grid_methods/`)

**Example: Finding Component Information**
A user wanting to know about fluvial erosion components could navigate to the User Guide -> Component List, find relevant components like `FastscapeEroder` or `ErosionDeposition`, and then follow the links to the API Reference for detailed parameters and methods. They could also check the `field_definitions.md` page (powered by `index.toml`) to see which components *provide* or *use* specific fields like `topographic__elevation` or `sediment__flux`.

### 5.4. JOSS Publication Workflow

For contributors publishing Landlab components via the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS), a specific workflow involving separate branches for the `paper.md` file is documented to avoid conflicts. *(Source: `docs/source/development/contribution/joss_workflow.md`)*.

## 6. Development Practices (as documented)

The documentation outlines key practices for Landlab development:

*   **Git Workflow:** Use feature branches, keep forks updated, use clear commit messages, and submit changes via Pull Requests. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/develop_with_git.md`)*.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated testing runs on GitHub Actions (previously Travis/AppVeyor) for Linux, macOS, and Windows across supported Python versions. PRs must pass CI checks. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/continuous_integration.md`, `.github/workflows/*.yml` descriptions in `README.md`)*.
*   **Coding Style:** Follow PEP8 and numpydoc conventions. Use `flake8` for checking and tools like `black` and `isort` (run via `nox -s lint` or `make pretty`) for auto-formatting. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/style_conventions.md`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`)*.
*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive doctests (for examples) and unit tests (using `pytest`) covering different scenarios and edge cases. Aim for high test coverage. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/writing_tests.md`)*.
*   **Dependencies:** Core dependencies are in `requirements.in` (derived from `pyproject.toml`). Development, testing, notebook, and docs dependencies are in separate files (`requirements-*.in`, `requirements/*.txt`). `environment*.yml` files provide convenient Conda environment setups. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/dependencies.md`, `requirements/`, `environment*.yml`, `pyproject.toml`)*.
*   **Releases:** Follow a specific workflow involving merging `master` to `release`, tagging, CI checks, PyPI/conda-forge uploads, and creating `-dev` tags. *(Source: `docs/source/development/practices/dev_guide_releases.md`)*.
*   **Package Organization:** The documentation (`docs/source/development/package_organization.md`) describes the standard directory structure.

## 7. About Landlab
