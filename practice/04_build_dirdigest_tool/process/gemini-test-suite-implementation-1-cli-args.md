Yes, yes, YES! Taking it step by step! That's the spirit! It's like building a magnificent LEGO castle – you don't just dump all the bricks on the floor and hope for the best (unless you're going for an *avant-garde* deconstructed castle, which, you know, could be a statement). You start with the foundation, brick by glorious brick!

I'm practically buzzing with excitement to get these initial pieces in place. This is where the groundwork for all your future testing triumphs will be laid!

Let's finish up that `conftest.py` with the `temp_test_dir` and the `mock_pyperclip` fixture. Then we'll sculpt our first tiny little universe, the `simple_project` mock directory. And finally, the grand debut of `test_cli_args.py`!

Here we go!

**1. Complete `tests/conftest.py`**

This file is like the backstage crew for your testing theatre – making sure all the props and settings are ready for the main performance!

```python
# tests/conftest.py
import pytest
import shutil
import os
from pathlib import Path
from click.testing import CliRunner
from unittest import mock

# Define the root for mock directory structures, relative to this conftest.py file
MOCK_DIRS_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent / "fixtures" / "test_dirs"

@pytest.fixture
def runner() -> CliRunner:
    """Provides a Click CliRunner instance for invoking CLI commands."""
    return CliRunner()

@pytest.fixture
def temp_test_dir(tmp_path: Path, request):
    """

    'name_of_mock_dir' should be a subdirectory under tests/fixtures/test_dirs/
    The fixture will yield the Path object to the created temporary test directory.
    """
    mock_dir_name = request.param
    source_path = MOCK_DIRS_ROOT / mock_dir_name

    if not source_path.is_dir():
        # Oh, for crying out loud! If the mock directory isn't there, what are we even DOING?!
        # It's like planning a picnic and forgetting the food, the basket, AND the park.

    # and to make it easier to identify test-specific temp files if needed.
    test_specific_tmp_dir = tmp_path / mock_dir_name
    
    # Make sure the parent of test_specific_tmp_dir exists. tmp_path itself exists.
    # No, shutil.copytree will create test_specific_tmp_dir if it doesn't exist.
    # However, if mock_dir_name contains slashes (e.g. "category/my_mock"), then
    # tmp_path / "category" needs to exist. But request.param should be a simple name.
    # For simplicity, assume mock_dir_name is a single directory name.

    shutil.copytree(source_path, test_specific_tmp_dir)

    original_cwd = Path.cwd()
    os.chdir(test_specific_tmp_dir)
    
    # Yield the path to the temporary directory where the test files are copied
    # This is the path tests will operate in.
    try:
        yield test_specific_tmp_dir
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_cwd)
        # shutil.rmtree(test_specific_tmp_dir) # tmp_path fixture handles cleanup of its contents
                                             # so we don't need to explicitly remove.

@pytest.fixture
def mock_pyperclip(monkeypatch):
    """
    Mocks pyperclip.copy and pyperclip.paste.

    def custom_pyperclip_copy(text_to_copy):
        clipboard_content_dict["text"] = text_to_copy

        mock_copy_object(text_to_copy)
        # If you needed to simulate an exception from pyperclip.copy, you could do it here:

    # PyperclipException is often used. Let's ensure it's available for tests to catch.
    # We need to import it where it's used or make it available via the mock.
    # The dirdigest.utils.clipboard module imports pyperclip directly.
    # So, if tests need to `except pyperclip.PyperclipException`, they can import it themselves.
    # However, if the `clipboard.py` module itself needs to *raise* a specific type from
    # a mocked function, it's good practice to patch that too if the original isn't available.
    # For now, this seems fine as `clipboard.py` catches `pyperclip.PyperclipException`.
    
    # Let's also patch the PyperclipException in the module where it's caught,
    # just in case the real pyperclip isn't installed in the test environment,
    # or to control the type of exception for testing.
    # This is tricky if the module itself does `import pyperclip`.
    # A simpler way is to ensure tests mock the call *that raises* the exception.
    # The current custom_pyperclip_copy can be made to raise an error.
    # Let's assign a known exception type to the mock object so tests can use it.
    
    # If pyperclip is not installed, `import pyperclip` fails.
    # We assume pyperclip is a dependency of dirdigest.
    try:
        import pyperclip # to get the real Exception class
        mock_copy_object.PyperclipException = pyperclip.PyperclipException
        mock_paste_object.PyperclipException = pyperclip.PyperclipException
    except ImportError:
        # If pyperclip is not installed, create a dummy exception class
        # for tests to use when they expect this specific exception from the mock.
        class DummyPyperclipException(Exception):
            pass
        mock_copy_object.PyperclipException = DummyPyperclipException
        mock_paste_object.PyperclipException = DummyPyperclipException


    return mock_copy_object, mock_paste_object, clipboard_content_dict

```

Phew! That `mock_pyperclip` is a little more involved, isn't it? But it gives us lovely control, which is what we crave! Control over the uncontrollable digital ether! (Or just, you know, testing clipboard stuff without actually messing with your real clipboard. Sanity is precious.)

**2. Create the `simple_project` Mock Directory**

Now, let's build that first little world.

Make sure you have this directory structure:

```
tests/
├── fixtures/
│   └── test_dirs/
│       └── simple_project/          <-- Create this directory
│           ├── file1.txt
│           ├── file2.md
│           └── sub_dir1/            <-- Create this subdirectory
│               └── script.py
├── conftest.py
└── (your future test files will go here)
```

And here's some sample content for the files:

**`tests/fixtures/test_dirs/simple_project/file1.txt`**:
```text
Hello world.
This is file1.
It has some text content.
```

**`tests/fixtures/test_dirs/simple_project/file2.md`**:
```markdown
# Markdown File

This is `file2.md`.

- Item 1
- Item 2

```python
print("A little python block here")
```
```

**`tests/fixtures/test_dirs/simple_project/sub_dir1/script.py`**:
```python
# This is a simple Python script.
def main():
    print("Hello from script.py in sub_dir1!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Isn't it cute? Our very own `simple_project`! It's like a digital bonsai tree.

**3. Create `tests/test_cli_args.py`**

And now, the star of our current show: the first actual test file! This will focus on the most basic CLI interactions – making sure your tool even responds to "hello?" (in the form of `--help` and `--version`).

```python
# tests/test_cli_args.py

import pytest
from click.testing import CliRunner
from dirdigest import cli as dirdigest_cli # Assuming your cli.py has main_cli
from dirdigest.constants import TOOL_NAME, TOOL_VERSION

# No need to import temp_test_dir if tests don't use the filesystem yet,
# but good to keep in mind for later.

def test_cli_help_short_option(runner: CliRunner):
    """Test the -h help option."""
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli, ["-h"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Usage: dirdigest [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]" in result.output
    assert TOOL_NAME in result.output # Check if the tool name appears in help
    assert "--output" in result.output # Check for a known option
    # Rich formatting check could be more complex, e.g., looking for ANSI codes if not stripped
    # For now, content check is a good start.

def test_cli_help_long_option(runner: CliRunner):
    """Test the --help option."""
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli, ["--help"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    assert "Usage: dirdigest [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]" in result.output
    assert "--include" in result.output # Check for another known option

def test_cli_version_option(runner: CliRunner):
    """Test the --version option."""
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli, ["--version"])
    assert result.exit_code == 0
    # The default version output format for Click is "{prog_name} version {version}"
    expected_output_start = f"{TOOL_NAME} version {TOOL_VERSION}"
    assert result.output.strip().startswith(expected_output_start)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("temp_test_dir", ["simple_project"], indirect=True)
def test_cli_basic_invocation_no_args(runner: CliRunner, temp_test_dir):
    """
    Test basic invocation with no arguments.
    It should process the current directory (which is temp_test_dir/simple_project).
    This is a smoke test to ensure it runs without crashing.
    More detailed output validation will come in other test files.
    """
    # We don't need mock_pyperclip here yet unless we're asserting its calls
    # or the clipboard content. For a basic smoke test, it's fine without.
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli) 
    
    assert result.exit_code == 0, f"CLI failed with output:\n{result.output}\nStderr:\n{result.stderr}"
    # A very basic check that some Markdown output might be present
    assert "# Directory Digest" in result.output
    assert "simple_project" in result.output # The name of the dir it's running in
    # Further checks (like clipboard) would require mock_pyperclip fixture

@pytest.mark.parametrize("temp_test_dir", ["simple_project"], indirect=True)
def test_cli_non_existent_directory_arg(runner: CliRunner, temp_test_dir):
    """Test providing a non-existent directory as an argument."""
    # temp_test_dir changes CWD, so 'non_existent_dir' is relative to that.
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli, ["non_existent_dir"])
    assert result.exit_code != 0  # Should fail
    # Click's default error message for a Path(exists=True) type failing.
    # It usually includes "Invalid value for '[DIRECTORY_ARG]'". Let's check for "Error"
    assert "Error" in result.output or "Error" in result.stderr # Click errors often go to output
    assert "does not exist" in result.output or "does not exist" in result.stderr


@pytest.mark.parametrize("temp_test_dir", ["simple_project"], indirect=True)
def test_cli_file_as_directory_arg(runner: CliRunner, temp_test_dir):
    """Test providing an existing file as the directory argument."""
    # temp_test_dir is the CWD, which is tests/fixtures/test_dirs/simple_project/
    # So, 'file1.txt' is directly inside it.
    file_path_arg = "file1.txt" 
    result = runner.invoke(dirdigest_cli.main_cli, [file_path_arg])
    assert result.exit_code != 0  # Should fail
    assert "Error" in result.output or "Error" in result.stderr
    assert "is a file" in result.output or "is a file" in result.stderr

```

And there we have it! Our very first set of building blocks! You've got your `conftest.py` with essential helpers, a sample directory to play with, and `test_cli_args.py` ready to poke at your CLI's most basic behaviors.

From here, we can expand:
*   More CLI argument tests (for options like `--output`, `--format`, etc.).
*   Tests for file traversal and filtering logic (using `temp_test_dir` extensively).
*   And so much more!

Doesn't it feel good to lay a solid foundation? It's like... that satisfying click when a LEGO piece snaps perfectly into place. Pure bliss! What delightful part of this grand testing tapestry shall we weave next? Or do you want to run these first and see that beautiful green glow of passing tests? (I highly recommend it, it's good for the soul!)
