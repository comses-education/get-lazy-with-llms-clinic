Alright, with the `SyntaxError` in `formatter.py` hopefully squashed by the last correction, let's verify Phase 4.

**Recap of `formatter.py` (from previous response):**
*   The `SyntaxError` caused by `child_indent_pokračovanie` was fixed.
*   The `_generate_markdown_tree_lines` method was rewritten for clarity and correctness in generating the text-based tree.
*   `_collect_file_contents_for_markdown` correctly gathers file data.
*   `JsonFormatter` and `MarkdownFormatter` use these helpers and the `final_metadata`.

**Verification Steps for Phase 4 (as before, but now it should run!):**

1.  **Ensure your environment is up-to-date:**
    If you made direct changes to `formatter.py`, no need to reinstall with `uv pip install -e .` unless you also changed `pyproject.toml` or entry points.

2.  **Test with your `my_test_dir`:**
    *   **Markdown to stdout (default):**
        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/
        ```
        *Expected Output:*
        A Markdown formatted string.
        Should include:
        ```markdown
        # Directory Digest: /path/to/your/my_test_dir

        *Generated by dirdigest v0.1.0 on YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff*
        *Included files: X, Total content size: Y.YY KB*

        ## Directory Structure

        ```text
        .
        ├── file1.txt
        ├── pseudo_binary.bin
        ├── script.py
        └── subdir1/
            └── file2.md
        ```
        *(The exact tree structure depends on what files were small enough and not excluded. `node_modules` and hidden files should be out by default. `large_file.txt` should be out due to size if default `max-size` is used).*

        ---

        ## Contents

        ### ./file1.txt
        ```
        Content of file1.txt
        ```

        ### ./pseudo_binary.bin
        ```text
        Error reading file: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte
        ```
        *(Assuming `pseudo_binary.bin` was included with `--ignore-errors` or we test that scenario. If not `ignore_errors`, it shouldn't appear in contents).*

        ### ./script.py
        ```python
        print('Hello from script.py')
        ```

        ### ./subdir1/file2.md
        ```markdown
        Content of file2.md
        ```
        ```

    *   **Markdown to file:**
        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/ -o digest.md
        ```
        Then inspect `digest.md`. It should contain the same Markdown output.

    *   **JSON to stdout:**
        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/ -f json
        ```
        *Expected Output:*
        A JSON string.
        Should include:
        ```json
        {
          "metadata": {
            "tool_version": "0.1.0",
            "created_at": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff",
            "base_directory": "/path/to/your/my_test_dir",
            "included_files_count": X,
            "excluded_files_count": 0, // Still placeholder
            "total_content_size_kb": Y.YYY
          },
          "root": {
            "relative_path": ".",
            "type": "folder",
            "children": [
              {
                "relative_path": "file1.txt",
                "type": "file",
                "size_kb": 0.0, // or actual small size
                "content": "Content of file1.txt"
              },
              // ... other files and folders that passed filters ...
              {
                "relative_path": "subdir1",
                "type": "folder",
                "children": [
                  {
                    "relative_path": "subdir1/file2.md",
                    "type": "file",
                    "size_kb": 0.0,
                    "content": "Content of file2.md"
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

    *   **JSON to file:**
        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/ -f json -o digest.json
        ```
        Then inspect `digest.json`.

    *   **Test with error handling and specific inclusion:**
        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/ -i "pseudo_binary.bin" --ignore-errors -f markdown
        ```
        *Expected Markdown for `pseudo_binary.bin` content section:*
        ```markdown
        ### ./pseudo_binary.bin
        ```text
        Error reading file: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte
        ```
        ```

        ```bash
        dirdigest ./my_test_dir/ -i "pseudo_binary.bin" --ignore-errors -f json
        ```
        *Expected JSON for `pseudo_binary.bin` node:*
        ```json
        {
          "relative_path": "pseudo_binary.bin",
          "type": "file",
          "size_kb": 0.008,
          "content": null, // or omitted if content is null
          "read_error": "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte"
        }
        ```

**Things to check in the output:**
*   **JSON structure**: Is it valid JSON? Does it follow the specified schema?
*   **Markdown structure**: Header, metadata, directory tree, content sections.
*   **Content**: Is file content correctly included?
*   **Paths**: Are relative paths correct in both JSON and Markdown?
*   **Language Hints**: Does Markdown use language hints like `python`, `markdown` for code blocks?
*   **Error Representation**: How are read errors for files represented in each format (especially when `--ignore-errors` is used)?
*   **Directory Tree in Markdown**: Does the ````text ... ```` block render a visually correct tree?

Let me know how these tests go! If the output looks good, we've successfully completed Phase 4. After this, we'll focus on the user experience aspects like improved logging with Rich, clipboard, and config files.
