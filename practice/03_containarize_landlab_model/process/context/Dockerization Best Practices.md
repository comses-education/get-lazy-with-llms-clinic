# Dockerizing the Landlab Overland Flow Simulation

Based on your application's structure, here are the best practices for creating an effective Docker container:

## Choosing the Right Base Image

Use Python's official slim image rather than Alpine for scientific computing:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
```

The slim variant offers a good balance between size and functionality. Avoid Alpine for scientific Python applications as it can make builds up to 50Ã— slower due to compiling dependencies from source instead of using pre-built wheels.

## Optimizing Layer Structure

Minimize the number of layers to reduce image size by combining related commands:

```dockerfile
# Inefficient approach
RUN pip install numpy
RUN pip install matplotlib 
RUN pip install landlab

# Better approach
COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
```

Group similar operations together to reduce image size and build time.

## Managing Dependencies Properly

Use your existing `pyproject.toml` file to manage dependencies:

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
COPY pyproject.toml .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -e .
COPY . .
```

This approach leverages your existing dependency management while ensuring packages are cached efficiently.

## Handling Matplotlib Visualization

Since your application uses matplotlib for visualization, you'll need to configure it for a headless environment:

```dockerfile
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV MPLBACKEND="Agg"
```

For interactive visualizations, you'll need to:
1. Set up X11 forwarding with appropriate volumes and environment variables
2. Configure X11 authentication properly

## Complete Dockerfile Example

Here's a complete Dockerfile following best practices:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV MPLBACKEND="Agg"

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files first (for better caching)
COPY pyproject.toml .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -e .

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Run as non-root user for security
RUN useradd -m appuser
USER appuser

# Command to run the simulation
CMD ["python", "overland_flow_simulation.py"]
```

## Running the Container

Run the container with:

```bash
# For non-interactive mode (saving plots to files)
docker run -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output your-image-name

# For interactive visualization (X11 forwarding on Linux)
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app \
  --net=host -e DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  your-image-name
```

## Additional Best Practices

1. **Volume mounting**: Mount data and output directories to persist results between runs.

2. **Managing large datasets**: If your simulations involve large datasets, consider using Docker volumes instead of binding mounts for better performance.

3. **Use unprivileged containers**: Run your application as a non-root user for better security.

4. **Include metadata**: Add descriptive labels to your image:
   ```dockerfile
   LABEL maintainer="Your Name"
   LABEL version="1.0"
   LABEL description="Landlab Overland Flow Simulation"
   ```

5. **Optimize for CI/CD**: Consider multi-stage builds if you need to include build tools that aren't needed at runtime.

6. **Save output to files**: Modify your code to save plots to files rather than displaying them interactively for better container compatibility.
