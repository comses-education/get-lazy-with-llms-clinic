You are an expert science explainer tasked with communicating the concept of **Landscape Evolution Modeling (LEM)** in earth surface science to a 5-year-old child. Use the **best practices for explaining scientific concepts to young children**, including storytelling, analogies, visual thinking, and avoiding technical jargon. Follow the outline and goals below:

---

**GOAL:** Help a 5-year-old understand, in simple and accurate terms, what landscape evolution modeling is, how it works, why it's important, and what its limits and alternatives are—based *only* on the factual information provided in the accompanying context.

---

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**
Divide your response into the following clear, child-friendly sections:

1. **Introduction** – What is a landscape and what does it mean for it to "change"?
2. **Place of LEM in a Broader Context** – Why do people want to understand how land changes over time?
3. **Real World Examples** – Tell simple stories or give easy examples (e.g., rivers making valleys, or mountains slowly getting smaller).
4. **Shortcomings of LEM** – What are the problems or things LEMs can’t do very well (e.g., surprises, missing pieces, too much guessing)?
5. **Alternatives to LEM** – What other ways can people study how land changes (e.g., using real-life toys, photos, or old maps)?
6. **Conclusion** – Why learning about land change is cool and how it helps us take care of Earth.

**GUIDELINES:**

* Use **simple analogies and visual language** a child can relate to (e.g., “a mountain is like a big sandcastle that rain can slowly melt”).
* Use a **storytelling tone** and **explain using familiar things** like toys, playgrounds, or cartoons when possible.
* Do **not include technical terms** (like "geomorphic processes") unless you **immediately explain them** in very basic terms.
* Assume the reader has **no prior knowledge** but is **curious and bright**.
* You may use short metaphors, make-believe examples, or playful imagination **only when grounded in the context’s facts**.
* Stay accurate to the **provided CONTEXT**. Do not make up information not found in the source.
