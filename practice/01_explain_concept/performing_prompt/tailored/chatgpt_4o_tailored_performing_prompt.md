Explain the concept of "landscape evolution modeling" (LEM) in earth surface science, including its principles, applications, and how it represents terrain surfaces for a 5-year-old.

Please structure your response as follows:

1. **Introduction**: Begin with a simple explanation of what landscape evolution modeling is, focusing on the idea of how landscapes change over time.
2. **Place of LEM in a Broader Context**: Explain how LEM fits into the larger picture of understanding Earth's surface and the forces that shape it, without using complicated terms.
3. **Real World Examples**: Provide simple, relatable examples of how LEM is used in real life, such as how rivers, mountains, or valleys change.
4. **Shortcomings of LEM**: Briefly discuss some challenges or things that LEM can't always do perfectly, in a way that a 5-year-old can understand.
5. **Alternatives to LEM**: Mention other ways scientists might study how landscapes change, in simple terms.
6. **Conclusion**: Wrap up with a basic summary of why landscape evolution modeling is important for understanding Earthâ€™s surface.

Throughout your explanation, avoid any technical jargon, and focus on simple language and familiar concepts. Your goal is to make the concept of landscape evolution modeling accessible and fun for a young child.

Use the best practices for explaining complex scientific ideas to young children, focusing on analogies, storytelling, and clear visual or conceptual explanations.
