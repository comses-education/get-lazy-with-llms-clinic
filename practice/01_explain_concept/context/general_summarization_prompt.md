# Comprehensive Preservation Summarization Prompt

Create a comprehensive summary of the following [content type] that maintains the essence of the original while highlighting its illustrative elements. Preserve specific examples, analogies, case studies, and interesting facts that support the main ideas. The summary should be [length constraint] and structured to include both core concepts and their supporting illustrations. Adapt the language for [target audience], while ensuring technical accuracy and maintaining the original tone. Include a brief section at the end that highlights the most compelling analogies or examples from the text.

## Key Best Practices for Effective Summarization

**Be Clear and Specific**
- Define exactly what information you need summarized and which examples to preserve
- Specify the desired format (bullet points, paragraphs, etc.) and length constraints

**Preserve Illustrative Elements**
- Explicitly instruct the AI to retain examples, analogies, and interesting facts
- Use chain-of-thought prompting to encourage deeper analysis of illustrative elements

**Tailor to Audience**
- Adapt technical complexity and language based on the intended audience
- Consider specifying if the audience needs more context or background information

**Structure Effectively**
- Request a format that clearly distinguishes between main points and supporting examples
- Consider using headings or sections to organize complex information

**Combine Summarization Approaches**
- Utilize both extractive techniques (to preserve key examples verbatim) and abstractive techniques (to connect ideas)
- This balances preservation of specific details with overall readability

**Review and Refine**
- Always review AI-generated summaries for accuracy and completeness
- Check specifically that important examples and analogies haven't been omitted

## Example Implementation

"Summarize this research paper on climate change mitigation strategies, maintaining a balance between key findings and the specific case studies presented. Preserve the regional examples, statistical comparisons, and analogies used to illustrate complex concepts. Structure the summary in 300-400 words with clearly labeled sections for methodologies, findings, and practical applications. Ensure the summary is accessible to policymakers without specialized scientific backgrounds, while preserving the author's evidence-based approach. Highlight 2-3 of the most compelling examples or analogies that best illustrate the paper's central arguments."*
