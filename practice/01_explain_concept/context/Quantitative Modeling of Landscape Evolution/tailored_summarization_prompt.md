As an expert in earth science education, create a comprehensive summary of the document "Quantitative Modeling of Landscape Evolution" following these guidelines:

1. Capture all essential aspects of landscape evolution modeling (LEM) in earth surface science, including:
   - Fundamental principles and theoretical frameworks
   - Methods for representing and simulating terrain surfaces
   - Real-world applications and practical uses
   - Key terminology with clear, simple explanations

2. IMPORTANT: Preserve ALL specific examples, analogies, and interesting facts from the original document that help illustrate these concepts. These elements are crucial for making the information accessible to a young audience.

3. Structure your summary with clearly labeled sections for:
   - Core principles and mechanisms
   - How terrain surfaces are represented in LEM
   - Practical applications in earth science
   - Illustrative examples and analogies

4. Write in clear, well-structured paragraphs that maintain scientific accuracy while avoiding unnecessarily complex language.

5. Put all information in your own words while preserving the original meaning and significance.

This summary will serve as the ONLY context for another AI that must explain landscape evolution modeling to a 5-year-old. Therefore:
- Include information that could help illustrate complex concepts in simple terms
- Preserve concrete examples that could be adapted for a child's understanding
- Ensure no crucial information is omitted, as the explaining AI will have no other source material

The final summary should prioritize completeness over brevity, as it must provide all necessary information for the subsequent explanation task.
