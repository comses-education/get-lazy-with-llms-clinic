# Containerize the Overland Flow Model

In the previous example [Generate Landlab Overland Flow Model](./../02_generate_landlab_model/README.md) we used some relevant context to generated a simple model that uses the [landlab](https://github.com/landlab/landlab/) library with a single prompt:
```
    Generate a Python script that creates a simple overland flow simulation using Landlab's OverlandFlow component.
    Create a detailed README how to use this script with uv.
    CONTEXT: <INSERT ALL CONTEXT DOCS HERE>
```

Now let's ask to containerize it.

## Containerizing an existing repository (the lazy way)
If you are familiar with docker, please, skip this section (and forget that it's even here), otherwise continue reading:

1. Create a digest `<APPLICATION_DIGEST>` of the entire repository.
    - use https://gitingest.com or `dirdigest` directly if you repository is not very large (~ less 2MB of text)
    - split your repository up or exclude some files if it is very large (more than 2MB of text). Refer to the [previous example](./../02_generate_landlab_model/README.md) to learn how to digest huge repos.
2. [Optional] Ask `pplx`: 

    ```
        give me best practices on dockerizing this application: <APPLICATION_DIGEST>
    ```

3. Ask `gemini 2.5 pro`:

    ```
        Give me a complete guide on how to dockerize my application (consult the APP_DIGEST in CONTEXT) using best practices from CONTEXT.
        
        Add a docker-compose.yml and a Makefile
        Update the README.

        APP_DIGEST: <APPLICATION_DIGEST>
        CONTEXT: <DOCKERIZATION_BEST_PRACTICES>
    ```

Here is the [Dockerization Guide](./result/Dockerization%20Guide.md)

Next, we'll follow the dockerization guide:
1. Create all new files: Makefile, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml
2. run `make build`
3. run `make run` - This step failed miserably

## First Fail
`make run` failed with:
```
    ❯ make run
        Running simulation via docker compose up...
        Output plots will be saved to ./output_plots
        mkdir -p ./output_plots # Ensure host output directory exists
        docker compose up --remove-orphans

Let's feed the error right back into `gemini 2.5 pro`: [answer](./process/first-fail-gemini-answer.md)

After following suggested changes, `make build` fails even more miserably.

## Second Fail

```

Compose can now delegate builds to bake for better performance.
 To do so, set COMPOSE_BAKE=true.

Feed back into `gemini 2.5 pro`. Here are the suggested [changes](./process/second-fail-gemini-answer.md).
Change the `Dockerfile`.

## Third Fail
Now `make build` fails:

❯ docker compose build --no-cache
Compose can now delegate builds to bake for better performance.
 To do so, set COMPOSE_BAKE=true.

## The errors seem to be way too misterious. Let's switch to PPLX.

Now, this is actually not going well... It is supposed to be quite easy to dockerize a simple script like this.
Let's revert the previous `Dockerfile` changes, create a fresh digest of our repository (just in case) using `dirdigest` and ask `pplx`:

```
    Here is a digest of my app:
    
    <APP DIGEST>

    `make run` fails with:

    landlab_simulation_app | Traceback (most recent call last):
    landlab_simulation_app | File "/app/overland_flow_simulation.py", line 3, in <module>

    landlab_simulation_app | ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
    landlab_simulation_app exited with code 1
```
Perplexity suggests:
```
    This happens because the landlab package (or one of its dependencies) was compiled against an older version of NumPy with a different memory layout than what's present in NumPy 2.0. The package expects the NumPy data type to be 96 bytes, but the installed version (NumPy 2.0) provides 88 bytes
```
and the solution:

```
    The most straightforward fix is to downgrade NumPy to a version below 2.0. You can do this by modifying your pyproject.toml file:

```
```text
[project]
name = "landlab-overland-flow-demo"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A simple Landlab overland flow simulation."
dependencies = [
    "landlab",
    "numpy<2.0.0",  # Pin NumPy to a version below 2.0
    "matplotlib",
]

requires-python = ">=3.8"
```

[Full perplexity's answer](./process/pplx-answer.md)

This seems reasonable. After rerun `make build` and `make run` we can see the expected output in the terminal and the generated plots in the [`output_plots`](./result/dockerized-landlab-model/landlab-overland-flow-demo/output_plots/) folder:

![water_depth_simtime600s](./result/dockerized-landlab-model/landlab-overland-flow-demo/output_plots/water_depth_simtime600s.png)
![water_depth_simtime1200s](./result/dockerized-landlab-model/landlab-overland-flow-demo/output_plots/water_depth_simtime1200s.png)

![water_depth_simtime3600s](./result/dockerized-landlab-model/landlab-overland-flow-demo/output_plots/water_depth_simtime3600s.png)
![final_topography](./result/dockerized-landlab-model/landlab-overland-flow-demo/output_plots/final_topography.png)

Thus concluding successful dockerization of our model.
