Summarizing technical documentation well means distilling complex information while preserving its key purpose, structure, and accuracy. Here are best practices to follow:

---

### ✅ 1. **Understand the Audience**
- **For developers?** Focus on APIs, configs, error handling.
- **For executives?** Emphasize outcomes, capabilities, and limitations.
- **For new users?** Clarify setup, key concepts, and learning path.

---

### ✅ 2. **Read Before Summarizing**
- Skim the full document to get the structure.
- Identify **sections**, **code examples**, **diagrams**, and **key terms**.

---

### ✅ 3. **Extract Core Elements**
Look for and capture:
- **Purpose** — What problem does this solve?
- **Inputs/Outputs** — Parameters, data types, or formats.
- **Key steps** — Setup, configuration, and usage patterns.
- **Gotchas** — Common errors, warnings, or limitations.

---

### ✅ 4. **Use a Structured Format**
A solid summary can follow this structure:
- **Title/Context**
- **Purpose / What it does**
- **How to use / Key steps**
- **Inputs/Outputs / Parameters**
- **Important Notes / Warnings**

---

### ✅ 5. **Use Your Own Words**
Don’t just copy-paste; rephrase in simpler terms while preserving technical accuracy.

---

### ✅ 6. **Maintain Traceability**
Include **section titles or line references** so others can find the original content quickly.

---

### ✅ 7. **Use Bullets and Tables**
Great for comparing options, listing parameters, or summarizing function arguments.

---

### ✅ 8. **Stay Concise, But Precise**
Avoid vague words. Say:
> "Takes a JSON payload and returns a 200 OK with user metadata"  
instead of  
> "It processes something and gives a response."

---

### ✅ 9. **Verify with Examples**
If the doc includes examples, check your summary against them. Ensure consistency.

---

### ✅ 10. **Keep It Maintained**
If the original doc changes, the summary should too — especially if it’s shared widely.
